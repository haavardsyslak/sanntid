// --- RESOURCE ROUTINE --- //
/*
You will modify the resourceManager routine so that it... works...
(You know the drill by now...)

Note: The code in `main` does not contain checks that the final execution order is correct.

Hints:
 - Remember that you can do things outside the `select` too:
    ```Go
    for {
        select {
            cases...
        }
        other stuff...
    }
    ```
 - You should not need a `busy` boolean (or any other variables for that matter).
   But you might find it useful when experimenting...
 - `select` can have a `default` case.
 - You will need to completely restructure the existing code, not just extend it
